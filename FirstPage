    <h1>Brief story synopsis</h1>
    <body>
        Sekiro's main character is named Wolf. At the begining of the game Wolf's arm was cut by Genichiro while he was trying to save his master Kuro.
        Emma, a supporting character saved him and gave him a prothestic arm, that can be upgraded. Sekiro eventually manages to fight his way back to Kuro after
        remathcing Genichiro and winning. Kuro asks Wolf to help him sever the Dragon Blood's heritage that makes him and Kuro immortal.

    <h3>True ending process</h3>
    <body>
        The true ending for sekiro is extremely complicated.
        You will need...
<ul>
    <li>Dried Serpent Viscera</li>
    <li>Fresh Serpent Viscera</li>
    <li>Frozen Tears</li>
    <li>Dragon Tears</li>
</ul>
<body>
    After you have recieved the Dried Serpent Viscera and the Fresh serpent Viscera you must give them to the Divine Child that you meet near the end of the game.
    She will consume them and be in "writhing" pain for a while. When you come back at a later time she will then give you her frozen tear. To get the Dragons Tear,
    you will need to defeat the Divine Dragon, which is a required boss fight. After you have both the Frozen and Dragon tears you must go the battlefield from the
    begining of the game(where Genichiro cut of your arm). There you will find Genichiro and Kuro, then a boss fight will ensue. After you beat Genichiro, a younger
    Isshin the Sword Saint(Genichiro's adoptive Grandfather) will CLIMB out of his corpse, take his sword(that can kill immortals) and proceed to make you depressed.
    If you manage to beat the demon that is Ishhin, you will find Kuro collapsed on the ground nearby. A prompt will appear where you can pick "Give Dragon Tears and
    Frozen Tears". This will unlock the true ending and a cutscene will play.
